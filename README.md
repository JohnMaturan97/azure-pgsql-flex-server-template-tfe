# Terraform Configuration for Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server

This Terraform configuration sets up an Azure PostgreSQL Flexible Server, applies configurations, and manages related resources.

## Overview

The Terraform setup includes the following components:
1. **Variables**: Definition of all variables used across the configurations.
2. **Main Configuration**: Setup of the PostgreSQL server and related configurations.
3. **Outputs**: Output of important information like server IDs.
4. **Provider Configuration**: Specifies the required Terraform version, provider setup, and backend configuration.

## Files Description

- `variables.tf`: Declares variables used across the entire configuration.
- `main.tf`: Contains the main resource declarations for setting up the PostgreSQL server.
- `outputs.tf`: Defines the outputs after Terraform execution, useful for obtaining references to resources.
- `provider.tf`: Configures the Terraform providers and backend required for deployment.

## Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
### Terraform Cloud Setup
- **Backend Configuration**:
  This configuration uses Terraform Cloud as the backend with the following settings:
  ```hcl
  backend "remote" {
    hostname     = "app.terraform.io"
    organization = "<ORGANIZATION_NAME_HERE>"
    workspaces {
      name = "<WORKSPACE_NAME_HERE>"
    }
  }
  ```
### Required Variables on Terraform Cloud
Ensure the following variables are set in your Terraform Cloud workspace with the appropriate values:
- `client_id`: Azure Client ID (`ARM_CLIENT_ID`)
- `client_secret`: Azure Client Secret (`ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`)
- `subscription_id`: Azure Subscription ID (`ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`)
- `tenant_id`: Azure Tenant ID (`ARM_TENANT_ID`)
- `resource_group_name`: The name of the Azure resource group where resources will be deployed.
- `location`: The location/region where the Azure resources will be deployed.
- `admin_password`: The administrator password.
- `admin_username`: The administrator username.

- Install Terraform (>= 1.3.0)
- Setup appropriate environment variables for authentication.

### Initializing Terraform

Run the following command to initialize Terraform, which will download the necessary providers and set up the backend:

```bash
terraform init
```

### Applying Configuration

To apply the configuration and create resources in Azure, execute:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Review the plan and confirm the execution to proceed with the resource creation.

### Destroying Resources

To destroy the resources managed by this Terraform configuration, use:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Resource Details

### PostgreSQL Server
- **Customization**: The server can be customized with different configurations provided in `variables.tf`.
- **Security**: Includes settings for network access and optional encryption key management.

### Diagnostics and Monitoring
- **Logging**: Configures logging for PostgreSQL to ensure detailed monitoring.
- **Diagnostics**: Setup (optional) diagnostic settings to forward logs and metrics to specified Azure services.

### Networking
- **DNS and Subnets**: Manage DNS settings and linkages to subnets as required for server access and security.

## Variables Explanation

Detailed descriptions and default values for all variables are provided within `variables.tf`.

## Outputs

Outputs include the PostgreSQL server ID and other relevant resource identifiers useful for integration with other services or further automation.
